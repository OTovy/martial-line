    <h2>The Paradox of Martial Arts Practice</h2>

    <main class="content">
        <p>

            There is a fundamental contradiction in combat training, especially in anything dealing with fighting practicality.<br>
            Combat training is meant to teach how to act in situations of particularly high danger-high risk situations that threaten the fighter’s safety,<br>
            yet in order for the practice to take place, the training method must be one that keeps the trainee safe throughout the sessions,<br>
            and therefore can never reach the level of danger for which one is supposedly training.<br><br>

            From this we see that the very concept of "combat training" is an oxymoron.<br>
            Thus, the trainee never truly finds themselves practicing such situations, they always remain in speculative states of uncertainty, unless fate has it that they encounter (and survive) such a situation during their life.<br>
            And even then, that situation will differ from most other possible scenarios.<br><br>

            What training does provide, or at least is supposed to provide, is the sharpening of physical abilities and movement, sensory and emotional orientation, along with combative and survival senses.<br>
            This increases the chances of surviving dangerous self-defense situations.<br>
            However, these alone are not enough. In order for these abilities to transfer from the training environment to an environment of real high danger, there must be a set of tools that bridges the gap created by uncertainty and high entropy.<br>
            These tools are **intuition and intelligence**.<br><br>

            Practical training isn't merely a practice that teaches the most effective techniques for situations.<br>
            it is a practice that provides <b>Orientation</b>, <b>Intelligence</b>, and <b>Intuition</b>.<br>
            Everything else is a matter of <b>Luck</b>.<br>
            After all, fighting is a matter of probabilities, and combat training should be something that increases the probability of survival,<br>
            like playing poker, it's a game of skill in which one must wisely use those skills in situations of luck in order to increase the chances of winning.<br><br>

            What happens if you don’t even know you’re in the game?<br>
            It’s better to walk through the world holding a double-ace than a two-seven.<br>
            <b>Good Luck.</b>
