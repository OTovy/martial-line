            There are three main stances in combat movement. They differ from each other due to the physical possibilities available to the participants in the fight. The relationship between the body and the terrain changes, forcing the participants to adopt different movement tools to move optimally.<br><br>

            - On land you stand, in water you swim. -<br><br>

            Open stance - The center of gravity is above the base of support and supported by the legs, allowing the generation of great force and moving the entire body back and forth, along and across the horizontal plane.<br><br>

            Closed stance - The center of gravity is above the base of support and supported by the legs, allowing the generation of great force, but the body cannot move along or across the horizontal plane and is essentially fixed in place.<br><br>

            Ground - The center of gravity is not supported by the legs, and the body is essentially fixed in place.<br>
            (Ground is inherently closed; an open ground stance is almost immediately negated because there is an opportunity to improve the position to a standing stance.)<br><br>

            When standing, you and your opponent will be in the same stance, whereas on the ground you may be in the same stance, or one may be on the ground while the other is standing.<br><br>

            - In combat, situations may also arise where the body is suspended off the ground, in one way or another. This is a type of stance that requires aerial orientation - for example, when a fighter is thrown or falls and must react while in the air.<br><br>

        <h3>Standing</h3><br>
            The natural stance of humans is standing, which makes standing stances more intuitive than ground stances. The nervous and motor systems are primed for standing, giving this stance a survival and combat advantage due to several characteristics.<br><br>

            First, the head is not leading.<br>
            In many other animals, the head, the primary sensory system, is at the front in the direction of movement, which puts it at higher risk. In humans, however, it is aligned with the body's midline and can be protected behind the limbs. In addition, the head is elevated, allowing the eyes to detect threats from a greater distance.<br><br>

            As previously mentioned, the center of gravity is supported by the legs. The hip joint and gluteal muscles are the largest and strongest in the body, enabling mobility and the generation of great force from the heels through the rest of the body.<br><br>

            The hands are free for sensing, maneuvering, and precision, with a high density of nerve endings, force transmission capability in addition to fine movements, and a wide range of motion across three planes of movement and in various patterns.<br><br>

            Characteristics of an effective standing stance:<br>
            Dynamic (allows movement)<br>
            Stable (prevents sliding/falling)<br>
            Powerful (enables force generation)<br><br>

        <h3>Ground</h3><br>
Ground is usually a less intuitive stance for people; the nervous and motor systems are not tuned for movement in this stance. Without proper training, being in this stance is a disadvantage.<br>
However, while many fights start standing, they quickly move to the ground - partly intentionally and partly due to the inherently unbalanced nature of combat. For these reasons, it is important to also emphasize this stance to turn it from a disadvantage into an advantage.
