    <h2>Fighting Violence</h2>

    <main class="content">
        <p>
            To achieve cleanliness, one must focus on the dirt.<br><br>

            Martial arts deal with reducing harm rather than causing it, with defense rather than offense.<br>
            They focus more on neutralizing the threat’s ability to cause damage than on inflicting damage, on preserving life and fostering growth more than on killing and death, on love more than on violence.
            <br>
            In fact, combat training can serve as a kind of vaccination against violence.<br><br>

            The more advanced a fighter’s skills and abilities become, the more they can choose to act without unnecessary energy, without noise, and while minimizing harm.<br>
            This is caused mainly because of these factors:<br><br>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Neuromotor Calibration</b> – The body's physical systems, together with technical ability, develop and sharpen. This grants an advantage and better control of situations.<br>
            The body becomes stronger, movement becomes quick and precise, technique is executed accurately, and everything is synchronized in synergy.<br>
            A very strong person can move heavy weight gently; a weak person will struggle, shout, and flail in chaos.<br>
            From this we understand that gentleness belongs to the strong, just as silence belongs to the wise.
              </li>
              <br><br>
            <li><b>Emotional Calibration</b> – The emotional and cognitive systems expand.<br>
            An aggressive action or reaction stems from fear and anxiety-both for the attacker and the one being attacked.<br>
            As one progresses in martial skills, the fighter’s sense of capability increases, and thus the anxiety toward threats diminishes.<br>
            When a fighter knows they have the tools to handle a situation, the threat no longer seems terrifying, and there is no need to respond excessively.<br>
            Additionally, perception sharpens: what once seemed like a terrible threat now appears mild, and what once seemed mild now appears non-threatening. The assessment of danger and potential harm becomes more accurate.<br>
            Another aspect is the deepening emotional awareness toward oneself and others-understanding how a person perceives the experience of the moment and what emotions drive them allows for a response born of empathy.<br>
            This understanding leads to adopting a set of tools entirely different from fists and kicks-one that is accompanied by containment, love, and compassion.<br>
            All of this applies to any conflict, both physical and verbal.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>
            These factors create a situation in which even a somewhat trained person facing an untrained attacker is like an adult facing a toddler.<br>
            The adult does not feel threatened by the toddler, they can maneuver their body however they like at any moment.<br>
            Moreover, because the adult does not feel threatened, they have no desire or need to harm the other side, and it won’t happen even by accident.<br>
            They will likely choose a gentler, more pleasant approach.<br><br>

            What remains is a crying child, yelling and kicking to get what they want.<br>
            A child is not neutralized with a punch or a kick, but with a hug and a caress.<br>
            Likewise, an adult human is not neutralized through harm or fear-driven violence, but through compassion made possible by self-confidence and love.
