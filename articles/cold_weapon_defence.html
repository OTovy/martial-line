    <h2>Defense Against a Cold Weapon - Short-Range and Fatal</h2>

    <main class="content">
        <p>
            A weapon such as a knife or a stun gun gives a significant advantage to the person holding it. That is its purpose and its nature: it amplifies power, saves energy, and protects from pain.<br>
            The success of an armed attacker against an unarmed opponent is almost certain.<br>
            Therefore, defending against a weapon is unreasonable and, in fact, nearly impossible.<br><br>

            Blocks and joint locks of various kinds are not perfect and are vulnerable to small movement deviations-any such deviation can mean fatal contact with the weapon.<br>
            This type of fight is a dirty, high-entropy event. The likelihood of deviations and mistakes is high and almost guaranteed. When the attacker holds a weapon, the consequences of any such deviation are severe injury or death.<br><br>

            Avoidance and escape are preferable in terms of risk, but in a situation that forces confrontation, two combat attributes are required in order to succeed in defending against an armed attacker: <b>range management</b> and <b>the ability to neutralize the attacker</b>, usually with a knockout.<br>
            One must maintain a safe distance where the weapon cannot reach you, and time the entry into the range where a decisive strike can be delivered.<br><br>
            
            Most people use dummy tools-rubber or wood-to practice knife defenses, but such training does not provide reliable feedback. First, because in most real scenarios, survival during an attack occurs after an initial unexpected stab, and it is difficult to simulate that pain and pressure. Second, documentation and testimonies of real survival from stabbings are limited. Third, the dummy knife misleads the defender because it does not mark a hit clearly and definitively. Fourth, training does not allow for a realistic way to neutralize the attacker using extreme measures such as a knockout or a groin kick.<br><br>

            To truly begin investigating the thread of knife defense, one must analyze real cases-successes and failures-and attempt to practice defenses with tools that give a clear signal upon failure. For example, a <b>shock-knife</b>, which simulates a painful but non-lethal sensation upon contact, or a <b>colored marker</b>, which can mark the location of a fictitious stab.<br>
            If no color is found on the defender, they survived-and if there is,<br>
            they didn't.<br><br>
